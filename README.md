# Darwin World

## Description

This project is a grid-based zero-player game based around the idea of evolution.
The grid is inhabited by animals which compete to survive and preserve their genes through their offspring.
The project was made as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at AGH University of Krakow and implemented based on the specification provided [here](https://github.com/Soamid/obiektowe-lab/blob/master/proj/Readme.md) with the GUI using JavaFX.
